# Java Chess Game Project - Summary Reflection

## Project Experience
Working on this chess game was both challenging and rewarding. My partner and I successfully built a functional chess application with a clean GUI, sound effects, and move suggestions. Though we encountered obstacles along the way, I'm satisfied with our final product.

## Strengths
Our best decision was separating game logic (ChessGame.java) from the interface (ChessBoard.java), making debugging much easier. Using Java Swing kept the UI simple yet effective with its clean board design and piece graphics. The SoundManager implementation surprised me with how straightforward it was while adding nice feedback to gameplay.

## Areas for Improvement
Several aspects could have been better:
- Our move validation is inefficient, checking every possible square
- The Movement package remains largely unused despite our original intentions
- We missed implementing special rules like castling and en passant
- An AI opponent would have been a great addition
- Proper unit testing would have saved debugging time

## Key Lessons
This project taught me valuable lessons about software development. Planning realistic timelines is crucial - we underestimated how long features would take. I gained substantial experience with Java GUI programming and learned important lessons about resource management across different systems.

## Conclusion
I'm proud of our chess game, though with hindsight I would focus more on planning and architecture first. The most important takeaway is embracing iterative development - starting small and building incrementally. Despite challenges with our ambitious initial scope, seeing the finished product in action was incredibly satisfying and significantly improved my programming skills.
