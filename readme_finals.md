# Java Chess Game Project Reflection

## Project Overview and Experience

When my partner and I started this chess game project, we weren't entirely sure how complex it would get. Looking back now, I'm pretty satisfied with what we accomplished! We managed to create a fully functional chess game with all the standard rules, a nice GUI, and even some cool features like move suggestions and sound effects.

## What Worked Well

The decision to separate the game logic (ChessGame.java) from the user interface (ChessBoard.java) was definitely one of our best choices. This made debugging way easier since we could test the game rules separately from the UI. I remember we spent a whole afternoon trying to figure out why pawns couldn't capture properly, and having this separation made it much easier to find and fix the bug.

I'm also really happy with our use of Java Swing for the interface. At first, we were considering using a more modern framework, but sticking with Swing kept things simpler and more compatible across different systems. The board looks clean with the alternating colors, and the piece images add a nice touch.

The SoundManager implementation was something I initially thought would be complicated, but using the JavaSound API and generating tones programmatically turned out to be pretty straightforward. It adds a nice bit of feedback when moving pieces.

## Challenges and What Could Have Been Better

Looking back, there are definitely some things we could have improved:

1. **Performance Optimization**: Our current approach for validating moves involves checking every possible square for each piece, which isn't very efficient. If I were to do this again, I'd implement a more optimized algorithm that only considers the actual valid moves for each piece type.

2. **Code Structure**: The Movement package we created ended up being mostly unused. We had intended to implement separate classes for each piece's movement logic, but ended up coding all the movement rules directly in ChessGame.java. Better planning would have helped us avoid creating files we didn't use.

3. **Special Chess Rules**: We implemented the basic rules but missed some special ones like en passant and castling. We also don't have proper detection for check and checkmate - they're mentioned in the README but not fully implemented in the code. If we had more time, adding these would make the game complete.

4. **AI Opponent**: It would have been cool to add a simple computer opponent to play against. We discussed this early on but prioritized getting the core functionality working first, and then ran out of time.

5. **Testing**: We did a lot of manual testing, but we should have implemented proper unit tests. This would have saved us time in the long run, especially when we were making changes that affected multiple parts of the game.

## Lessons Learned

This project taught me a lot about planning and project management. When we first mapped out the features, we were ambitious but didn't account for how long each part would take. For future projects, I'll definitely make more realistic timelines and break down tasks into smaller, manageable pieces.

I also learned a ton about Java's GUI capabilities. Before this, I'd only done console applications, so building a complete graphical interface with event handling was a new challenge. It was satisfying to see everything come together visually.

Working with file paths and resources was trickier than expected. We had some issues with the images not loading properly on different computers, which taught me to be more careful about how I structure application resources.

## Final Thoughts

Overall, I'm proud of what we accomplished. The game works well, looks decent, and includes some nice features beyond the basic requirements. If I had to do it over, I'd focus more on planning the code architecture first and maybe start with a simpler version before adding all the features.

The biggest takeaway for me is the importance of iterative development - start with something small that works, then build on it step by step. We tried to implement too many features at once initially, which led to some confusion and backtracking.

Despite the challenges, seeing our finished chess game in action was really rewarding, and I feel like I've grown a lot as a programmer through this project.
